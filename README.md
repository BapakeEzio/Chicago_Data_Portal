> Final assignment for Coursera: Analysis of public Chicago datasets using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and SQLite queries.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project is the **final assignment** for the *Data Engineering / Data Analysis* course on Coursera.  
The goal is to **analyze three public Chicago datasets** to understand:  

- Socioeconomic conditions of each community area  
- School performance in Chicago  
- Crime patterns across the city  

Analysis is performed using **Python, Pandas, SQLite, and data visualization libraries**.

---

## ðŸ—‚ Datasets Used
1. **Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago**  
   - Six socioeconomic indicators + *hardship index* for years 2008â€“2012  
   - [Dataset link](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2)  

2. **Chicago Public Schools (CPS) 2011â€“2012**  
   - School-level performance data used for *School Report Cards*  
   - [Dataset link](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-Progress-Report-Cards-2011-/9xs2-f89t)  

3. **Chicago Crime Data (2001 â€“ present)**  
   - All reported crimes (except murder by victim data)  
   - [Dataset link](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2)  

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- Python 3.12.4  
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- SQLite (via Python)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for data visualization  

---

## ðŸ“Š Insights & Analysis
- SQLite queries are used to **combine & analyze datasets**  
- Patterns found include correlations between:  
  - Socioeconomic indicators & crime rates  
  - School performance & hardship index  
- Visualizations make insights easy to understand  

**Example Visualization:**  

![Example Visualization](./screenshots/visualization.png)  
> This chart shows the relationship between hardship index and crime rates per Chicago community area.  

*(Optional: Replace with GIF animation of interactive visualization for more impact.)*
