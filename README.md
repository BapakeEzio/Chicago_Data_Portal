# Chicago_Data_Portal
## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project is the **final assignment** for the *Data Engineering / Data Analysis* course on Coursera.  
The goal is to **analyze three public Chicago datasets** to understand:  
- Socioeconomic conditions of each community area  
- School performance in Chicago  
- Crime patterns across the city  

Analysis is performed using **Python, Pandas, SQLite**.
